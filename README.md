# Real-World-Optimization-with-Genetic-Algorithms
This project presents a suite of real-world optimization problems solved using Genetic Algorithms (GA), implemented entirely in Python. It features four modules across diverse domains. The first module tackles a smart car parking problem by allocating 50 vehicles—including electric and disabled-driver cars—into a 10x10 grid while minimizing walking distances and enforcing priority constraints near charging stations and entrances. The second module optimizes a 30-day investment strategy, balancing expected returns and drawdown risks across five trading options while applying penalties for consecutive strategy repetitions and high volatility. The third module simulates an escape scenario where an agent must navigate a mafia-infested 3x50 grid within 70 steps, evolving movement patterns to avoid detection. The fourth module builds a 5-day optimal travel itinerary across 50 attractions, maximizing enjoyment and minimizing cost within time constraints. Each module incorporates key GA components such as chromosome representation, fitness evaluation, tournament selection, crossover, mutation, and convergence logic. The project emphasizes scalable, adaptable AI for decision-making and planning.
